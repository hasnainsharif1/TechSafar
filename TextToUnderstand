Okay, let's break down everything that's going on in your project, file by file, starting with the Frontend and then moving to the Backend.

---

## Frontend Overview (React)

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, styled using Material-UI, and managing state with Redux Toolkit. It interacts with your Django backend via REST APIs.

### `frontend/src/index.js`

This is the main entry point of your React application.
-   **Purpose:** Renders the root React component (`App`) into the `index.html` file's `div` with `id="root"`. It also sets up global contexts.
-   **Key Changes/Role:**
    *   **Redux Provider:** Crucially, it now wraps the entire `<App />` component within `<Provider store={store}>`. This makes your Redux store (where all your application's state lives) accessible to *any* component in your React application that needs it. This was the fix for the "could not find react-redux context value" error.
    *   **Material-UI `CssBaseline`:** This component from `@mui/material` helps kickstart a consistent, elegant, and simple baseline to build upon. It normalizes CSS across browsers.
    *   **`StrictMode`:** React's strict mode is activated for development to highlight potential problems in an application.

### `frontend/src/App.js`

This file defines the main application structure, routing, and global components like the Navbar and Snackbar.
-   **Purpose:** Acts as the central hub for routing, global UI elements, and overall application flow.
-   **Key Changes/Role:**
    *   **React Router:** Sets up `BrowserRouter` (`Router`), `Routes`, and `Route` components to handle navigation within the SPA. Each `Route` maps a URL path to a specific page component.
    *   **`Navbar` Component:** This is a separate functional component (defined within `App.js` for now) that renders the top navigation bar using Material-UI's `AppBar`, `Toolbar`, and `Button` components.
        *   **Dynamic Links:** It uses Redux's `useSelector` to check `isAuthenticated` state. Based on this, it conditionally renders "Login" and "Register" buttons (if not logged in) or "Profile", "Sell Product", "Create Shop", and "Logout" buttons (if logged in).
        *   **Logout Functionality:** It dispatches the `logout` thunk from `authSlice` and redirects to the home page.
    *   **`PrivateRoute` Component:** A higher-order component that checks if a user is authenticated. If not, it redirects them to the `/login` page using `Navigate`. This secures routes like `/profile`, `/products/create`, and `/shops/create`.
    *   **Global Snackbar:** Implements a Material-UI `Snackbar` at the application level.
        *   It uses local state (`snackbar`) to control its visibility, message, and severity.
        *   A `showSnackbar` function is passed down as a prop to components like `Login`, `Register`, and `Profile` (and will be used in CreateProduct/Shop) to easily display global notifications from anywhere in the app.
    *   **Imported Pages:** Imports all your main page components (`Home`, `Login`, `Register`, `Products`, `ProductDetail`, `CreateProduct`, `Shops`, `ShopDetail`, `Profile`).
    *   **Routes Defined:**
        *   `/`: Home page
        *   `/products`: List of products
        *   `/products/:id`: Detail page for a specific product
        *   `/products/create`: Form to create a new product (protected)
        *   `/shops`: List of shops
        *   `/shops/:id`: Detail page for a specific shop
        *   `/shops/create`: Form to create a new shop (protected)
        *   `/login`: Login form
        *   `/register`: Registration form
        *   `/profile`: User profile page (protected)

### `frontend/src/store/index.js`

This file configures and creates your Redux store.
-   **Purpose:** Centralizes your application's state management.
-   **Key Changes/Role:**
    *   **`configureStore`:** From Redux Toolkit, this function simplifies store setup. It automatically combines reducers, adds `redux-thunk` middleware (for handling asynchronous actions), and sets up Redux DevTools Extension for easy debugging.
    *   **Root Reducer:** Combines all your individual slice reducers (`authReducer`, `productReducer`, `shopReducer`, `chatReducer`) into a single root reducer. Each slice manages a specific part of your application's state.
    *   **Middleware Configuration:** Disables the serializable check in middleware, which can be useful when dealing with non-serializable data in Redux actions (like `FormData` for file uploads).

### `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.js`

This Redux slice manages all authentication-related state and actions.
-   **Purpose:** Handles user login, registration, profile retrieval, profile updates, and logout.
-   **Key Changes/Role:**
    *   **`createAsyncThunk`:** Defines asynchronous actions (thunks) for interacting with your backend API using `axios`.

        *   `register`: Sends new user data to `backend/users/register/`.
        *   `getProfile`: Fetches the current user's profile from `backend/users/profile/` using the stored `access_token`.
        *   `updateProfile`: Sends updated profile data (via `PATCH` request) to `backend/users/profile/` using the stored `access_token`.
        *   `logout`: Clears `access_token` and `refresh_token` from `localStorage`. (Optionally, could also hit a backend logout endpoint if available).
    *   **`createSlice`:** Defines the reducer logic and initial state for the auth slice.
    *   **`initialState`:** Manages `user` data, `token`, `isAuthenticated` status (derived from `localStorage`), `loading` status, and `error` messages.
    *   **`extraReducers`:** Handles the `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected` states for each `createAsyncThunk` action, updating the `loading`, `error`, `user`, `token`, and `isAuthenticated` states accordingly. It also clears tokens on logout.

### `frontend/src/store/slices/productSlice.js`

This Redux slice manages product-related state and actions.
-   **Purpose:** Handles fetching, creating, updating, and deleting product data, including categories.

    *   **`extraReducers`:** Manages state changes for all product-related thunks, updating corresponding state properties.

### `frontend/src/store/slices/shopSlice.js`

This Redux slice manages shop-related state and actions.
-   **Purpose:** Handles fetching, creating, updating, and deleting shop data.
-   **Key Changes/Role:**

They suppress common linter false positives that occur in Django projects where the linter might not fully understand dynamic imports or ORM attributes like `.objects`. This ensures your editor doesn't show misleading errors while your code is actually correct.
    *   `"pythonVersion"`, `"typeCheckingMode"`: Configures the Python version and how strictly Pyright checks types.
